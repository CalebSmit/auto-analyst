# Amendments

*Append-only. Every change to the plan, and why. Written by `gate amend` — do not edit
by hand, and never delete an entry: an amendment that turned out to be wrong is more
useful than one that was quietly removed.*

Read this when the plan looks wrong. It probably changed for a reason.

## 2026-09-02 — Founding decisions

These were taken before P01 opened, from the architecture blueprint and from Caleb's
answers during planning. Recorded here because a decision without its reason becomes a
convention nobody will question later.

**Why:** the plan needed a starting position on the things that are expensive to change
after week three.

- **Repo lives at `C:\dev\automated-analyst`, not in the OneDrive folder.** A synced
  `.git` and `.venv` on Windows is a file-lock and corruption hazard, and this project
  writes thousands of run artifacts. The blueprint HTML and `project-context.md` stay in
  OneDrive; this repo points at them.
- **Toolchain: `uv`, Python 3.12 pinned, `uv.lock` committed.** One tool for version,
  venv and locking, and a lockfile that reproduces exactly on the work machine without
  needing Poetry installed there first.
- **SQLite behind a repository port for P01–P24; the same conformance suite runs against
  Postgres in Docker from C2 onward.** This is the ports pattern the architecture already
  uses, applied to the state store, so the swap is a URL — and running both is what stops
  SQLite-only SQL creeping in unnoticed.
- **`.env` plus the secrets port from day one.** At handoff, moving to the firm's
  Anthropic account is a `.env` change and nothing else.
- **Named job recipes produce the plan until P26; the LLM orchestrator arrives last.**
  Debugging plan compilation and a model's plan proposal simultaneously means trusting
  neither. The blueprint has `job_recipes` seeding the orchestrator, so this is a
  sequencing choice rather than a departure.
- **The three existing work repos — model builder, ShareFile connector, Box connector —
  are adapters to write at handoff, not dependencies to satisfy.** The model builder is an
  input to P21 and should be read before the Template Writer is written; it may already
  solve the named-range binding.

## 2026-09-02 — Four findings from the pre-build review, folded into the plan

**Why:** a review of the blueprint before any code was written found four things that
would have surfaced weeks into the build. All four were fixed in the blueprint as well,
so the HTML and this plan agree.

- **F1 — `engagement_profile` had no producer.** EBITDA Normalization, GPC Scrub and Cost
  of Capital all declare it as a required input; nothing emitted it. Repurchase Obligation
  declares `participant_census`, likewise. Invariant 23 had already decided the answer —
  configuration writes the engagement record — so this was a missing *contract*, not a
  missing design. **Lands in P02** as a schema, and in **P24** as a preflight check at
  activation.
- **F2 — nothing owned the parse that provenance and tie-out read from.** The figure
  envelope carries a `locator`; provenance asserts the `source_id` is in the intake
  manifest; the recompute engine re-derives totals *from the source rows*. All three need
  a persisted, addressable parse that outlives the step that produced it, and no node
  owned it. **Lands in P17** as the Source Parse Store, keyed `(run_id, source_id,
  locator)`, written once and never updated. This was the most expensive of the four to
  have found late.
- **F3 — the tool namespace is six names and three of them are gated reads.** Skills
  declare `recompute`, `timing_normalizer`, `template_schema_lookup`,
  `chart_of_accounts_lookup`, `precedent_lookup`, `index_lookup`; the map has three tool
  *nodes*. The other three resolve to data resources. Not a defect, but building the
  runtime for compute tools alone would have been. **Lands in P10.**
- **F4 — the stack picked the Claude Agent SDK for the reasons single-turn forbids.** The
  SDK was justified by subagents with per-invocation tool allowlists and native
  progressive disclosure; `max_turns == 1` removes both, and the Guarded Tool Runtime
  dispatches every tool because the Policy Gate must see it. What stays valuable is
  `SKILL.md` as a *file format*, which owes nothing to any SDK. **Lands in P11:** the LLM
  port speaks the Messages API, we parse skill files ourselves, and the Agent SDK is an
  optional adapter rather than a dependency in the first three months. MCP for Box is
  unaffected and arrives with delivery.

A fifth, smaller finding — five stale node and edge counts in the blueprint's own prose
and its `NODECLASS` table — was corrected in the HTML and is now checked by a harness.
